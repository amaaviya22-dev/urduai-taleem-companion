An AI-powered Urdu learning companion built using structured prompt engineering with Gemini.
# UrduAI Taleem Companion

UrduAI Taleem Companion is a prompt-engineered AI learning assistant designed to support Urdu learners with structured explanations, examples, and contextual responses rather than generic chatbot replies.

## Problem
Urdu learners often struggle to get clear, structured, and culturally relevant explanations from existing AI tools, which usually respond in generic or mixed-language formats.

## Solution
This project uses structured prompt engineering with Gemini to:
- Teach Urdu concepts step by step
- Provide examples in pure Urdu
- Act as a learning companion instead of a general chatbot

## Technology
- Gemini (Google AI)
- Prompt Engineering
- AI Studio (for interactive demo)

## Demo
Live interactive demo available via AI Studio link (submitted separately).

## Status
Early prototype created specifically for this hackathon.
